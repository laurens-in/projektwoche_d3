# Notes

You will not be able to reproduce all the steps that i took with these scripts, because i changed them between conversion steps. I was not aware that i had to upload this code so that one could reproduce it and i do not have the time to clean everything up.

## Code Folder
In this folder are the node scripts that i used to parse the tweets, calculate controversiality and format them in a way that would later be nice to make a graph

## Graphs Folder
I used a lot of time this week to get to know D3js, a very extensive Data Science Library for Javascript. I did not get very far but i managed to make a graph which will on mouseover show tweet texts. If you want to check this out for yourself you have to host this folder with somthing like "http-server". I did not manage to get the text formatting right, since all in this graph is in svg and text formatting in svg is just beyond me and beyond what i could achieve within this week.
